{"name":"Methpat","tagline":"A program for summarising CpG methylation patterns","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThis program summarises the resultant DNA methylation pattern data from the output of [Bismark](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/) bismark_methylation_extractor. Information of the DNA methylation positions for each amplicon, DNA methylation patterns observed within each amplicon and their abundance counts are summarised into a tab delimited text file amenable for further downstream statistical analysis and visualization.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Whole genome bisulfite short read sequencing data (WGBS), or Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), or Bisulfite Amplicon Sequencing.\r\n* Bismark v0.12.2 and it’s dependencies (bwa v0.7.5a-r405).\r\n* Python 2.7 or above (but not Python 3).\r\n* Methpat and it’s dependencies [https://github.com/bjpop/methpat](https://github.com/bjpop/methpat).\r\n* A modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMethpat currently requires version 2.7 of Python.\r\n\r\nThe best way to install Methpat is to use the following command:\r\n\r\n    pip install git+https://github.com/bjpop/methpat.git\r\n\r\nThis will automatically download and install the dependencies of methpat.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\nmethpat [-h] [--count_thresh THRESH] --amplicons AMPLICONS_FILE\r\n        [--logfile FILENAME] [--html FILENAME]\r\n        [--webassets {package,local,online}] [--title TITLE]\r\n        BISMARK_FILE\r\n\r\nSummarise methylation patterns in bismark output, and generate visualisation.\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  BISMARK_FILE          input bismark file\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  --count_thresh THRESH\r\n                        only display methylation patterns with at least THRESH\r\n                        number of matching reads, defaults to \"0\"\r\n  --amplicons AMPLICONS_FILE\r\n                        file containing amplicon information in TSV format\r\n  --logfile FILENAME    log progress in FILENAME, defaults to \"methpat.log\"\r\n  --html FILENAME       save visualisation in html FILENAME defaults to\r\n                        \"methpat.html\"\r\n  --webassets {package,local,online}\r\n                        location of assets used by output visualisation web\r\n                        page, defaults to \"package\"\r\n  --title TITLE         title of the output visualisation page, defaults to\r\n                        \"Methylation Patterns\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Explanation of arguments\r\n\r\n* `--dump_reads FILE`: Dump the read methylation information to FILE. Mainly useful for debugging methpat behaviour.\r\n* `--count_thresh THRESH`: Only display methylation patterns with at least THRESH number of matching reads.\r\n* `--amplicons AMPLICONS_FILE`: Input file containing amplicon information in TSV format (described below).\r\n* `--logfile FILENAME`: Output log progress in FILENAME.\r\n* `--html FILENAME`: Save visualisation in html FILENAME.\r\n* `--webassets {package,local,online}`: Location of assets used by output visualisation web page. Web assets are files needed by the HTML visualisation (javascript and CSS files). Each option has the following meaning:\r\n    * `package`: web asset files are found in the directory where methpat is installed on your computer. These files are automatically set up when methpat is installed. You do not need to do any extra steps to make this work, therefore it is the default behaviour for methpat. This mode is useful for viewing the HTML visualisation on the same computer where methpat is installed. It is not useful for sharing the visualisation with others or publishing on the internet as a web page.\r\n    * `local`: web asset files are found in the directory containing the HTML visualisation file - they must be copied there manually by the user. The web asset files can be found in the `methpat/data` sub-directory of the source code repository. This mode is useful for sharing the files with others who wish to view the HTML visualisation without an internet connection.\r\n    * `online`: The web assets are stored on the internet. This mode is useful for sharing the visualisation with others or publishing on the internet as a web page.\r\n* `--title TITLE`: Title of the output visualisation page, defaults to \"Methylation Patterns\".\r\n\r\n## Amplicons File Definintion\r\n\r\nThe amplicons or regions of interest are defined by this tab-delimited text file. The order\r\nof regions listed in this file will correspond to the order of display in the html file generated.\r\nThe file requires 7 columns which define:\r\n\r\n1. chromosome\r\n2. start coordinate of amplicon/region of interest\r\n3. end coordinate of amplicon/region of interest\r\n4. name of amplicon/region of interest\r\n5. size of amplicon/region of interest\r\n6. length of forward PCR primer of amplicon/region of interest, number of base pairs to ignore from the start\r\n7. length of reverse PCR primer of amplicon/region of interest, number of base pairs to ignore from the end\r\n\r\nSee the file [examples/example_amplicons.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjpop/methpat/master/examples/example_amplicons.txt) for an example input amplicons file, which is used in the worked example below.\r\n\r\n## Worked example\r\n\r\nRun Bismark as per instructions to prepare the reference genome as outlined in the [bismark manual](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/Bismark_User_Guide.pdf).\r\n\r\nRun Bismark to align raw read files (fastq) as below with no mismatches:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbismark -n 0 -q -o <nameOfOutPutDirectory> --bam --ambiguous --chunkmbs 10204 --non_directional /path/to/reference/genome <fastq.file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun bismark methylation extractor to create an output text file containing read DNA\r\nmethylation pattern information:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbismark_methylation_extractor -s <bismarkAlignedFileName.bam>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a series of text files prefixed with the methylation orientation and reference\r\ngenome strand data was extracted from. For the purposes here, the files prefixed with CpG\r\nare then processed with methpat.\r\n\r\nFor each bismark output file with a `bismark.txt` suffix, run the following command to generate the methpat output. The example below uses the data files in the `examples` directory of the methpat source package:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmethpat --amplicons example_amplicons.txt example1_bismark.txt > example_methpat.tsv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above example generates three output files:\r\n\r\n1. `example_methpat.tsv`: summarises the read count and DNA methylation pattern information for all amplicons/regions of interest listed in the amplicons file.\r\n2. `methpat.log`: log information about the progress of the methpat program (useful for debugging purposes if things don't work as you expect, also records the command line that was used just in case you want to run the exact same command again).\r\n3. `methpat.html`: interactive HTML visualisation of the methylation patterns for each amplicon/region of interest. This is best viewed in Chrome, Firefox and Safari (but not Internet Explorer).\r\n\r\nSee the file [examples/methpat.html](pages/methpat.html) which contains the visualisation of the above worked example.\r\n\r\n## Format of the methylation pattern counts output text file\r\n\r\nOne of the main outputs of methpat is a tab-delimited text file which summarises the counts for each methylation pattern over all amplicons from the input. In the example above this output file is called `example_methpat.tsv`. The file has seven columns containing the following information:\r\n\r\n1. `amplicon ID`: the identifier of an amplicon from the input amplicons file.\r\n2. `chr`: the chromosome containing the amplicon\r\n3. `Base position start/CpG start`: the coordinate of the first CpG site in the amplicon.\r\n4. `Base position end/CpG end`: the coordinate of the last CpG site in the amplicon.\r\n5. `Methylation pattern`: an encoding of the methylation status of each CpG site in the amplicon. The code \"1\" means that the site is methylated. The code \"0\" means the site is unmethylated. The code \"-\" means that the methylation status of the site is unknown. An example is \"11-011-0-\" for an amplicon with nine CpG sites, four of which are methylated, three are unmethylated and two are unknown.\r\n6. `count`: the number of times this particular methylation pattern for the amplicon is seen in the Bismark file.\r\n7. `raw cpg sites`: the methylation status of each CpG site for this pattern. It is a list of comma-separated pairs in the form \"(CpG coordinate, methylation status)\". Coordinates with unknown methylation status are not shown in the list.\r\n\r\nSee the file [examples/methpat.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjpop/methpat/master/examples/example_methpat.tsv) which contains the methylation counts from the above worked example.\r\n\r\n## Visualisation\r\n\r\nMethpat outputs a visualisation of the methylation patterns for each amplicon in the input in a HTML file. By default the file is called `methpat.html` but you can override this with another name using the `--html` command line option.\r\n\r\nYou can view the visualisation in a web browser (any modern web browser will do, though it hasn't been tested thoroughly with Microsoft Explorer).\r\n\r\nEach amplicon in the input appears in the visualisation. The order of the amplicons in the visualisation is the same as the input file (if you want to change the order you must edit the input file and re-run methpat). \r\n\r\nA screenshot is shown below for the DAPK1_p1_106 amplicon from the worked example - the red letters are annotations which are referred to in the explanation below the image.\r\n\r\n![Screen grab of part of the methpat visualisation for the worked example](images/example_methpat_vis.png)\r\n\r\nThe main part of the visualisation (A) shows all the methylation patterns for the amplicon. Each pattern is displayed as a column of coloured boxes. By default a yellow box indicates a methylated CpG site, a red box indicates an unmethylated CpG site, and a blue box indicates a CpG site whose methylation status is unknown. By default the patterns are sorted left-to-right in order of frequency of occurrence. The columns are sequentially numbered. The numbers are merely ordinals that can be used to refer to columns, which can be useful when discussing a diagram within a manuscript. In the image above the most frequent pattern is methylated in all CpG sites (all boxes are yellow in column number 1).\r\n\r\nThe coordinates of each CpG site are listed on the left side of the digram (C). By default they are shown in ascending order from top-to-bottom, however this can be changed to descending order in the page settings (discussed below).\r\n\r\nA frequency histogram of each pattern is shown as a bar chart below the patterns (B). By default the vertical axis of the graph is raw read counts for each pattern, however this can be changed to a percentage of total reads in the page settings. The vertical scale is linear by default but it can be changed to log scale in the settings.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of methylated, unmethylated and unknown methylation for each CpG site across all reads for a given amplicon are shown in coloured rectangles to the left of the patterns (D). In the image above the first CpG site (90112806) is predominantly methylated (mostly yellow), which a small amount of unmethylated sites (red).\r\n\r\nThe green button at the bottom of the diagram (E) allows you to save a copy of the diagram to file in PNG format.\r\n\r\n![Screen grab of part of the methpat visualisation settings](images/methpat_vis_settings.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
