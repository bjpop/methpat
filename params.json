{"name":"Methpat","tagline":"A program for summarising CpG methylation patterns","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThis program summarises the resultant DNA methylation pattern data from the output [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/](Bismark) bismark_methylation_extractor. Information of the DNA methylation positions for each amplicon, DNA methylation patterns observed within each amplicon and their abundance counts are summarised into a tab delimited text file amenable for further downstream statistical analysis and visualization.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMethpat currently requires version 2.7 of Python.\r\n\r\nThe best way to install Methpat is to use the following command:\r\n\r\n    pip install git+https://github.com/bjpop/methpat.git\r\n\r\nThis will automatically download and install the dependencies of methpat.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n\r\n    usage: methpat.py [-h] [--dump_reads FILE] [--count_thresh THRESH] --amplicons\r\n                      AMPLICONS_FILE --logfile FILENAME\r\n                      BISMARK_FILE\r\n\r\n    Count methylation patterns in bismark output\r\n\r\n    positional arguments:\r\n      BISMARK_FILE          input bismark file\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n      --dump_reads FILE     dump the read methylation information to FILE\r\n      --count_thresh THRESH\r\n                            Only display methylation patterns with at least THRESH\r\n                            number of matching reads\r\n      --amplicons AMPLICONS_FILE\r\n                            Only display methylation patterns with at least THRESH\r\n                            number of matching reads\r\n      --logfile FILENAME    log progress in FILENAME","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
